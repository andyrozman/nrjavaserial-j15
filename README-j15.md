# nrjavaserial-j15
Neuron Robotics Java Serial API (fork) for Java 1.5

This is just fork so that I can build Java 1.5 library, instead of 1.6 as it is with orginal repository.

I use this in my application and I need 1.5 version. This binary will be also deployed in my repository. 
So when changes are merged here (I will try to do this at least twice a year) new version should be available 
in my nexus repository.
